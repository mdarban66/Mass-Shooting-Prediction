# Mass-Shooting-Prediction

In this work, we took advantage of Twitter data and gathered Tweets related to gun violence through Twitter Search API. Following that some sort of data mining methods, such as Logistic Regression and SMO helped us to find a relation between Twitter data and corresponding mass shooting events that were highly possible to happen in near future.
